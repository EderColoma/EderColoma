### About me

I have been programming since 2000, when I took my first programming course, and have been a professional programmer since 2004.<br>
Over the years I learned (and forgot :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:) a few programming languages, like Clipper, Pascal, Visual Basic, Delphi, ASP, ColdFusion, C and C++ (you won't find anything written on those languages here though). Nowadays I mostly use Java, PHP and SQL, I am trying to learn JavaScript in order to be able to create a full application and I am also studying Haskell (functional programming:bangbang:) beacause it is fun.
During my career I have worked on several different projects, from a simple website to fighter aircrafts software, here goes a list of the ones I am prouder of:
<br>
<br>:heavy_check_mark: Maintenance system for the C-390 Millenium aircraft.
<br>:heavy_check_mark: Airspace and air traffic management simulation system.
<br>:heavy_check_mark: Computer based training system for the Gripen E/F fighter aircraft.
<br>:heavy_check_mark: Air traffic statistical software.
<br>:heavy_check_mark: Tax bookkeeping software used by several towns in Brazil.
<br>:heavy_check_mark: Air traffic control service charging software for Venezuela.
<br>
<br>In my spare time I like playing video games :video_game:, listening to metal music :guitar:, watching movies and series :tv: and practicing wing chun :wrestling:.
