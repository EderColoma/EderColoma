### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! <br>
Here you will find my projects and somethings I have been coding for studying purposes, or just for fun ðŸ˜„

### About me

I have been programming since 2000, when I took my first programming course, and have been a professional programmer since 2004.<br>
Over the years I learned (and forgot :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:) a few programming languages, like Clipper, Pascal, Visual Basic, Delphi, ASP, ColdFusion, C and C++ (you won't find anything written on those languages here though). Nowadays I mostly use Java, PHP and SQL, I am trying to learn JavaScript in order to be able to create a full application and I am also studying Haskell (functional programming:bangbang:) beacause it is fun.
During my career I have worked on several different projects, from a simple website to fighter aircrafts software, here goes a list of the ones I am more proud of:
<br>
<br>:heavy_check_mark: Maintenance system for the C-390 Millenium aircraft.
<br>:heavy_check_mark: Airspace and air traffic management simulation system.
<br>:heavy_check_mark: Computer based training system for the Gripen E/F fighter aircraft.
<br>:heavy_check_mark: Air traffic statistical software.
<br>:heavy_check_mark: Tax bookkeeping software used by several towns in Brazil.
<br>:heavy_check_mark: Air traffic control service charging software for Venezuela.

In my spare time I like playing video games (:video_game:), listening to metal (:guitar:), watching movies and series (:tv:) and playing tennis (:tennis:). I also competitively play Krosmaster (a boardgame :game_die:).
